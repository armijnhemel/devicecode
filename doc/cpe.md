# Processing CPE data

Common Platform Enumeration, or [CPE][cpe], is naming convention for software,
hardware, operating systems, and so on, and is used extensively in the security
industry, for example on the NVD CVE pages, where CPEs are used for listing so
called "Known Affected Software Configurations" ([example][cve-2006-2561]) and
can be used as a key to look up CVEs and other security information.

The CPE data is published as a data dump in XML format.
