# DeviceCode Text User Interface

To quickly browse devices it is more efficient to use a specialized interface
instead of relying on tools such as `grep` and `less` to look at raw JSON
output.

A TUI (text user interface) can be a quick and easy way to browse and search
results.

## Representing results

There are many ways results can be represented and there is no single best way
to represent these results. Depending on which element is the most important
the data should be presented in a different way.

An obvious way would be to have a tree, with brands at the top and device
models as leafs, with perhaps an additional layer for the various wiki types
that were parsed.

If a CPU or chip is the most important element, then the results could be
represented as a tree, with chip vendors at the top, chip model numbers as
subtrees, and individual devices as leafs.

If operating system is the most imporant, then the results could be sorted
by operating system. If release year is the most important, then it could be
sorted by year, and so on.
