# Processing LineageOS data

TechInfoDepot and WikiDevi mostly seem to focus on devices such as routers,
access points, single board computers, and so on. Other projects have
information about other devices, such as tablets or phones. One such project
is LineageOS.

The data used on the LineageOS wiki is available in
[their GitHub repository][lineageos-git] in YAML format.
